[Intro]

Oh, in a blink, gone
Blink, gone
I Can't let it go
Blink and gone

The clock goes tick tock tick tock
Just enjoy it
Blink, gone
Oh, in a blink, gone
Let's go

[Verse 1]

This moment
Won't ever come back
The party's getting started

Let’s go crazy
High

Wave both hands
Let the rhythm take over

This music
On and on
See upcoming pop shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Pre-Chorus]

The verdant lights
Tickle my eyes
And I smile

Before this piercing, radiant moment
Fades away

[Chorus]

Oh, in a blink, gone
Forget everything and just enjoy

Oh, in a blink, gone
Don't miss this moment

I’m tellin’ you Blink, gone
Leave no regrets

The clock goes
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Blink, gone

[Pre-verse]
Oh, in a blink, gone
Blink and gone
Relish the present

In a blink, gone

[Verse 2]

Clear your mind
Leave the burdens behind
Make this party yours

And no, don’t look back now

Neither yesterday nor tomorrow
Exist for me

It’s this moment, or no

[Pre-Chorus]

The dark crimson air
Embraces us
Lifting our spirits

And the fiery thrill
Blazes out to the sky
[Chorus]

Oh, in a blink, gone
Forget everything and just enjoy

Oh, in a blink, gone
Don't miss this moment

I'm tellin' you Blink, gone
Leave no regrets

The clock goes
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Blink, gone

[Bridge]

Oh, in a blink, gone
Forget everything and just enjoy

Oh, in a blink, gone
Don't miss this moment

I'm tellin' you Blink, gone
Leave no regrets

The clock goes tick tock tick tock

[Chorus]

Oh, in a blink, gone
Forget everything and just enjoy

Oh, in a blink, gone
Don't miss this moment

I'm tellin' you Blink, gone
Leave no regrets

The clock goes
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Blink, gone
